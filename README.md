# Datafusion WASM User Defined Functions

Very simplistic datafusion user defined functions written in WASM.

POC has been built on top of [Wasmedge](https://wasmedge.org) library.
It is not terribly performant, with lot of coping and serializing data.

It has been implemented to demonstrate DataFusion `FunctionFactory` functionality ([arrow-datafusion/pull#9333](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/pull/9333)) & `WASM UDF` ([arrow-datafusion/pull#9326](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/issues/9326)).

Other project in `FunctionFactory` series:

- [Torchfusion, Opinionated Torch Inference on DataFusion](https://github.com/milenkovicm/torchfusion)
- [LightGBM Inference on DataFusion](https://github.com/milenkovicm/lightfusion)
- [Apache Datafusion JVM User Defined Functions (UDF), integration nobody asked for ðŸ˜€](https://github.com/milenkovicm/adhesive)

> [!NOTE]

> - It has not been envisaged as a actively maintained library.

## Installation

In order to be able to compile project WasmEdge library [should be installed](https://wasmedge.org/docs/start/install).

or using brew:

```bash
brew install wasmedge
```

Why [WasmEdge](https://wasmedge.org)? It provided good enough examples to pick up wasm/rust integration.

## Define Function

Define a rust function ([wasm_function](wasm_function/)) like:

```rust
// expose function f1 as external function
// add required bindgen, and required serialization/deserialization
wasm_udf::export_udf_function!(f1);

/// standard datafusion udf ... kind of 
/// should return ArrayRef or ArrowError (or any error implementing to_string)
fn f1(args: &[ArrayRef]) -> Result<ArrayRef,ArrowError> {
    let base = args[0]
        .as_any()
        .downcast_ref::<Float64Array>()
        .expect("cast 0 failed");
    let exponent = args[1]
        .as_any()
        .downcast_ref::<Float64Array>()
        .expect("cast 1 failed");

    let array = base
        .iter()
        .zip(exponent.iter())
        .map(|(base, exponent)| match (base, exponent) {
            (Some(base), Some(exponent)) => Some(base.powf(exponent)),
            _ => None,
        })
        .collect::<Float64Array>();

    Ok(Arc::new(array))
}
```

which will be compiled to a `wasm` module with:

```bash
cd wasm_function
cargo build
```

An artifact should be available at `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/wasm_function.wasm`.

`export_udf_function!` macro should add WasmEdge bindings and peace of code which would do Arrow IPC serialization/deserialization. Arrow arrays are effectively copied across rust/wasm boundary using Arrow Ipc.

This code currently handles happy path scenario, with some exceptional cases covered.

## UDF Declaration

```rust
let sql = r#"
CREATE FUNCTION f1(DOUBLE, DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
LANGUAGE WASM
AS 'wasm_function.wasm!f1'
"#;

ctx.sql(sql).await?.show().await?;

ctx.sql("select a, b, f1(a,b) from t").await?.show().await?;
```

[full example](wasmedge_factory/examples/wasaffi.rs)

should produce something similar to:

```text
+-----+-----+-------------------+
| a   | b   | f1(t.a,t.b)       |
+-----+-----+-------------------+
| 2.0 | 2.0 | 4.0               |
| 3.0 | 3.0 | 27.0              |
| 4.0 | 4.0 | 256.0             |
| 5.0 | 5.1 | 3670.684197150057 |
+-----+-----+-------------------+
```

Function is declared in format `wasm_function.wasm!f1`, where `wasm_function.wasm` represents module to load and `f1` a function to call.
